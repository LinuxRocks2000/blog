<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft, I love you so<br />
Your services are super slow<br />
All I want is crappy junk<br />
From pop-up ads that browser funk</p>

  <p>You make me laugh, you make me cry<br />
But mostly only say goodbye<br />
I use websites with better scripts<br />
That I wrote on break, just for kicks</p>

  <p>To your services<br />
That suck when they work<br />
I say that<br />
Bill Gates is such a jerk</p>

  <p>To destroy the world<br />
Of Linux, GNU<br />
And code the first Windows<br />
And make FSF stew</p>

  <p>Yet I agree, you once were great<br />
XP wasn’t bad<br />
And I’m sure I soon will wait<br />
For customer service that makes me sad</p>

  <p>Microsoft, this love letter<br />
Was written in duress<br />
By a guy whom your systems<br />
Angered and depressed</p>

  <p>I hope you know that you all stink<br />
And your services smell bad too<br />
As Mark Twain never said<br />
“You are the rat in my stew”</p>
