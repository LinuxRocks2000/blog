<p>[Photograph not shown for privacy reasons]</p>

<p>My name is Tyler Clarke. I am a teenage computer programmer from Georgia, with about 5 years of experience (so far).<br />
I program in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, C, Intel assembly, and Befunge-93.<br />
My first language was Scratch, and I eschew Java because it is a hatefully slow and inefficient language, not to mention the fact that it is ugly.<br />
(I like Python, which may make me a hypocrite. I donâ€™t really care.)</p>

<p>In my spare time, I write novels and this blog, which is what I am writing right now, hence the fact that you are reading this.</p>
