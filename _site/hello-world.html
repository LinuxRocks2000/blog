<p>Anyone who actually ever read my comic when it had a blog (ergo, nobody), knows that it used to be undeniably ugly.<br />
Then I did a bunch of javascript, totally refactored my entire site and… Even uglier!</p>

<p>So, in an attempt to write articles without killing people’s brains, I made this. I hope everyone likes the terrible colors!</p>

<p>Seriously, as this is a first blog post, I must make several points clear.<br />
First off, my blog will never have any explicit content. I flatter myself that I am not an idiot.<br />
Some of my posts may joke in socially incorrect ways - Hitler, racism, religion, and politics. These are intended to be funny and I will try to stay fair.</p>
