<p>Anyone who actually ever read my comic when it had a blog (ergo, nobody), knows that it used to be undeniably ugly.<br />
Then I did a bunch of javascript, totally refactored my entire site and… Even uglier!</p>

<p>So, in an attempt to write articles without killing people’s brains, I made this. I hope everyone likes the terrible colors!</p>

<p>Seriously, as this is a first blog post, I must make an important point clear:
some of my posts may joke in socially incorrect ways - racism, religion, and politics, to name a few. These are intended to be funny and I will try to stay fair. If you are offended, I’m sorry. You can’t expect the internet to always be a fairyland, and if you want something to be offended by, look anywhere on the internet. Getting your pannies in a wad will just waste my time.</p>

<p>Blogging is undeniably fun, but the routines can be hard - I won’t be posting weekly, and sometimes I might post daily.<collapsible-footnote citationName="[1]">This, quite obviously, is a footnote. *Italics with Markdown?* don't work, but <i>Italics with HTML</i> do. Dang, gotta remember that.</collapsible-footnote></p>

<h3 id="i-hope-you-like-my-site">I hope you like my site!</h3>

            Unfortunately, Google Ads is too awful to use on my site; I'm sure you're all very sad that this section is not filled with cheap Medicare.<br />
            Yes, my voice oozes sarcasm.
