# About me

[Photograph not shown for privacy reasons]

My name is Tyler Clarke. I am a homeschooled teenage computer programmer from Georgia, with about 5 years of experience (so far).  
I program in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C++, C, Intel assembly, and Befunge-93.  
My first language was Scratch, and I eschew Java because it is a hatefully slow and inefficient language, not to mention the fact that it is ugly.  
(I like Python, which may make me a hypocrite. I don't really care.)

In my spare time, I write novels and this blog, which is what I am writing right now, hence the fact that you are reading this.

## I'm looking for a part-time coding job - if you have anything you need programmed, please [E-Mail me](mailto:plupy44@gmail.com)
