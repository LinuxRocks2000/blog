<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<p>
    I am unaware as to how you landed here - whether it be recommendation from a friend, recommendation from me (if I'm your friend, which I might be - I'm an extrovert), or just stumbling here from Github or another blog. <br /><br />
    If it is the first - thank your friend (please). I hope you will like this blog, and I hope your friend will recommend more people :)<br />
    If it is the second, you don't have to thank me. I'm very forgiving.<br />
    If it is the third, you can click the little button that means "go back". That won't offend me, but you could also click one of the posts, which I am sure would be - if not the most exciting thing you have done/will do today - at least enjoyable.<br />
    <br />
    If you have decided to stay here, you have a couple options. First, you could hover over the weird orange bar - its actually a menu - and find a satisfactory blog post.<br />
    You could also check out my <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.posts.last.url }}">first post</a>, or if you like most recent things and/or don't care much about order, my
    <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.posts.first.url }}">last post</a>
    <br />
    (If I haven't written anything else / deleted a lot of my posts, both of those links will point to the <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.posts.last.url }}">first post</a>. You can make sure this is correct by checking how many posts there are in the little orange sidebar)
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em">This blog is not always politically correct or correct at all. Sorry?</p>
