# Hello, blogosphere! Its good to be back!  
Anyone who actually ever read my comic when it had a blog (ergo, nobody), knows that it used to be undeniably ugly.  
Then I did a bunch of javascript, totally refactored my entire site and... Even uglier!

So, in an attempt to write articles without killing people's brains, I made this. I hope everyone likes the terrible colors!

Seriously, as this is a first blog post, I must make an important point clear:
some of my posts may joke in socially incorrect ways - Hitler, racism, religion, and politics. These are intended to be funny and I will try to stay fair. If you are offended, I'm sorry. You can't expect the internet to always be a fairyland, and if you want something to be offended by, look anywhere on the internet. Getting your pannies in a wad will just waste my time.


Blogging is undeniably fun, but the routines can be hard - I won't be posting weekly, and sometimes I might post daily.<collapsible-footnote>Hi</collapsible-footnote>  


### I hope you like my site!
