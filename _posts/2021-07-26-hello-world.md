# Hello, blogosphere! Its good to be back!  
Anyone who actually ever read my comic when it had a blog (ergo, nobody), knows that it used to be undeniably ugly.  
Then I did a bunch of javascript, totally refactored my entire site and... Even uglier!

So, in an attempt to write articles without killing people's brains, I made this. I hope everyone likes the terrible colors!

Seriously, as this is a first blog post, I must make several points clear.  
First off, my blog will never have any explicit content. I flatter myself that I am not an idiot.  
Some of my posts may joke in socially incorrect ways - Hitler, racism, religion, and politics. These are intended to be funny and I will try to stay fair.
