Atheism is hated and, likely, feared by Christians around the globe, for utterly ridiculous reasons. This is because the concept of an Atheist is misunderstood world-wide. Most people seem to subconciously think of Atheism as a very bad thing, bringing up images of violence and militarism, to some people Nazism.  
To dispute the Nazi argument before it grows into an ugly troll, I would like to point out that Nazis ate food. Does it make you a Nazi to eat food? No? Then I guess it doesn't make you a Nazi to believe that there isn't a god.  
And that is literally the definition of Atheism. Dissect the word: A theism. Theism is belief in a god. A is a negative. Thus, Atheism is either "not belief in a god" or "belief that there is not a god".  
Latin 101.
