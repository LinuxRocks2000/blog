## Microsoft: A love letter
##### (don't read if you have a sense of rhyme/meter, a sense of humor, enjoy The Road Not Taken, or just have a taste in poetry in general)


> Microsoft, I love you so  
Your services are super slow  
All I want is crappy junk  
From pop-up ads that browser funk  
>
You make me laugh, you make me cry  
But mostly only say goodbye  
I use websites with better scripts  
That I wrote on break, just for kicks  
>
To your services  
That suck when they work  
I say that  
Bill Gates is such a jerk  
>
To destroy the world  
Of Linux, GNU  
And code the first Windows  
And make FSF stew  
>
Yet I agree, you once were great  
XP wasn't bad  
And I'm sure I soon will wait  
For customer service that makes me sad  
>
Microsoft, this love letter  
Was written in duress  
By a guy whom your systems  
Angered and depressed  
>
I hope you know that you all stink  
And your services smell bad too  
As Mark Twain never said  
"You are the rat in my stew"
